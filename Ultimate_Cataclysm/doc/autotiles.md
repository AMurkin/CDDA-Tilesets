### Plan:
You can either follow the template, putting each directional tile in the spot it belongs on the template, or you can use the specific names for each type of tile.
Using the specific names, you can also make multiple tile entries for a given tile type.
If the template is left transparent in a tile, the parser will need to know to ignore that tile.

Currently, there are only a few of these tiles supported in CDDA, although some day it would be nice to have all of them available. With the current tile support there are two ways you might use an autotile, demonstrated by the bench and table autotiles.
