## About this folder
This folder *should* be able to hold only JSON files, pointing to sprites identified in the large_64x64 folder, to keep from needing an entire separate spritesheet.

If I haven't edited or deleted this readme, then it has probably worked and I just forgot to edit the "should" bit out.

Either way, don't put images in here. Just JSON definitions for things you want centered in the tile instead of offset so that the bottom is on the edge.
