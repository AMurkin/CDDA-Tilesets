Ultimate Cataclysm (UltiCa) is a community made tileset for Cataclysm:dark days ahead

This repository stores individual sprites for UltiCa in PNG format, and also source files with layering in PSD (Photoshop) or XCF (gimp 2.10) format.

## Style Guides
- 32x32 tile base
- character and monster sprites 64x64 with 8px offset from the ground to give them a 3d look
- all art should be in a pseudo-16 bit format. While you can use the full range of modern colour palettes, each colour block of a sprite should be limited to 3-6 colours. For example a blue shirt might have one light blue highlight, two medium blue main colours, one dark blue shade, and one very dark blue-green shade.
- avoid outlines.
- the default light source is assumed to come from above and to the lef
- use PNG transparency to create a 50% opaque black drop shadow when possible, extending behind and to the right of the sprite.
